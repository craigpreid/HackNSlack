Project Description/Outline
Objective : We will use Vendorâ€™s API to access product and review data.  We will clean the raw data into workable dataframes and will examine the scope of data provide and attempt to answer commercially relevant questions about the online businesses we are investigating.
 
Limitations and challenges: We acknowledge that, while we have some access to product data, we do not have access to marketing and sales information.  This prevents us from answering the most salient questions such as, "What drives sales."  To overcome this limitation, we will look for proxy data or substitute comparisons between data sets which demonstrate the ability to answer more important questions if our team had access to the data.
 
Research Questions to Answer
Comparison of product offerings in common categories
Size and scope of datasets
Price comparison and geographical location of stores
Analysis of reviews
Differences/commonalities in assessment of common products
Look at price and store locations and determine which of those variables might be more significant for the survival of the companies
We anticipate modify the scope of research once we have more familiarity with the data
 
Data Sets to be Used
Walmart API
Best Buy API
